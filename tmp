# TODO - clustering
# (check whether "singleton", negative duration (e.g., discharge first) trajectories would get put in separate clusters)
# try clustering on current dataset, resulting pm's

# TODO - querying
# singleton trajectories, discharge-first, only-rehab, no-rehab trajectories
# "AB - Facility A 1" precedes "AB - Facility EC 3", "AB - Facility A 2" precedes "AB - Facility EC 2"
# rules to which SCU adm/disch must adhere:
# admissions precede discharges, adm[n+1] follows adm[n], no overlapping stays
# separate log based on profile (e.g., C5-C8, ..)
