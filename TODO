- querying

(praxis)
singleton trajectories, discharge-first, only-rehab, no-rehab trajectories
"AB - Facility A 1" precedes "AB - Facility EC 3", "AB - Facility A 2" precedes "AB - Facility EC 2"
rules to which SCU adm/disch must adhere:
admissions precede discharges, adm[n+1] follows adm[n], no overlapping stays
separate log based on profile (e.g., C5-C8, ..)

(TC) 
filter:
on associated resources/roles (only sum up time under control of TC!)
	contain, intersect, ... with time period for traces
analyze: 
count # traces on filtered traces
case duration per month (cases starting/ending in month)

esotheric
annotate events with "meaning"; do sanity checking
	ends before starts (that's just the lifecycle)
find time outliers
